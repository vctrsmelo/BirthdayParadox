# BirthdayParadox
The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of people in the room, is more than 23. This Java program test this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays, which test this paradox for n = 5,10,15,20,...,100
